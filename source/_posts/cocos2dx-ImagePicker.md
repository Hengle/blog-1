This extension plugin is able to load images from system photo library. Native calls for Android, iOS(iPhone+iPad) & Win32. More details can be found here [ImagePicker](https://github.com/qiankanglai/ImagePicker).

NOTE: please check the example files first before using! I've tested code with v3.5 and v3.10, and it should always work if the cocos2d::Texture2d related API doesn't break...

ps. I made a Pull Request to cocos before and it seems they don't need it. So I just put it here seperately.
