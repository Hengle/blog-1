## Bio

- Born in May, 1990
- From Wuxi, JiangSu Province, China
- Now Residing in Beijing

I'm a big fan of rendering and started playing around this when I was an undergraduate. Gained some experience about image processing, GPU acceleration in school, I'm working as a game developer in a small company. [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) is the main tool for me so most of my recent blogs are related to it, but I also spend a lot of part time playing with [UE4](https://www.unrealengine.com/) and [KlayGE](http://www.klayge.org/).
